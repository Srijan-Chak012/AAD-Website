                        <p class="text-lg mb-5">
                            Confidential computing ensures hardware-level privacy by encrypting data within a secure
                            enclave that no one, even the cloud provider, can see or access. Confidential computing is
                            easy to visualise as a hotel room safe. <br><br>
                            The hotel room is a private location within a
                            building where other people are staying, where you may anticipate some solitude to go about
                            your business and retain your possessions when you leave for the day. Of course, hotel
                            workers may still enter the room, so you're relying on them not to invade your privacy.
                            Items that require extra protection are locked in the room's safe, which only you know the
                            code to. This manner, even if hotel personnel needs to enter the room for cleaning, they
                            won't be able to reach the most important items. <br><br>
                            Confidential computing enables a corporation running workloads in the cloud or on-premises
                            to preserve complete privacy and control over their workloads despite not owning the
                            infrastructure on which the workload is housed.

                        <h4 class="mb-4">Quantum-Safe Cryptography</h4>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-5">
                            Despite the highly anticipated benefits of quantum computing, the technology's greater
                            ability to factor big numbers has many people concerned about the security of present
                            approaches to encryption as quantum computing evolves.
                            <br><br>
                            Recognizing these concerns, IBM
                            Research, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the wider
                            cryptography community have spent the last several years investigating innovative techniques
                            to encryption and data security in order to keep sensitive data secure from quantum
                            computers. One worry is that someone may grab encrypted data and keep it until quantum
                            computing goes far enough to defeat today's encryption standards.
                            <br><br>
                            The good news is that experts are working on quantum-safe encryption to combat attempts to
                            break encrypted data using quantum computers. The NIST sponsored a Post-Quantum Cryptography
                            Standardization challenge in 2016 to assist future-proof data against quantum computers.
                            <br><br>
                            Lattice encryption conceals data within complicated math problems (or algebraic structures)
                            known as lattices, which are usually illustrated using the "knapsack problem." "In most
                            circumstances, if today's encryption is replaced with lattices, the user will experience no
                            difference, save perhaps a speed increase in performance."
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="mb-4">Fully Homomorphic Encryption</h4>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-5">
                            Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is the third component of cryptography's future, allowing
                            data to stay encrypted throughout computation independent of the cloud or infrastructure
                            used to execute it. As a result, FHE may assist to spur broader use of hybrid cloud designs,
                            allowing data to travel across clouds without jeopardising security.
                            <br><br>
                            If we have an app that
                            needs to perform statistical analysis on a data set, the app must decrypt the data. However,
                            the process of decrypting the data renders it susceptible. We may prevent revealing the data
                            during computation by using FHE.
                            <br><br>
                            FHE is based on a different mathematical technique than standard encryption, with the goal
                            of allowing computations to be conducted directly on encrypted data. This new encryption
                            technique might enable third parties to handle and analyse encrypted healthcare, financial,
                            or other data in the cloud and send correct findings to the data owner without ever
                            revealing the original data in plain text.
