                            A cryptographic hash function is an algorithm that takes an arbitrary amount of data input—a
                            credential—and generates a fixed-size output of encrypted text known as a hash value, or
                            simply "hash." That enciphered text can then be saved instead of the password and used to
                            validate the user later.The security of password storage is influenced by certain aspects of
                            cryptographic hash algorithms.

                                <li><b>Non-reversibility, often known as one-way function.</b><br>A decent hash should
                                    make it
                                    extremely difficult to deduce the original password from the output or hash.</li>
                                <li><b>The avalanche effect, or diffusion.</b><br>A change in just one bit of the
                                    original password should cause a change in half of the hash's bits. In other words,
                                    if a password is slightly modified, the output of enciphered text should change
                                    considerably and unexpectedly.</li>
                                <li><b>Determinism.</b><br>A given password must always produce the same hash value or
                                    encrypted text.</li>
                                <li><b>Collision resistance.</b><br>It should be difficult to uncover two distinct
                                    passwords that hash to the same encrypted text.</li>
                                <li><b>Non-predictable.</b><br>The hash value should be unpredictable based on the
                                    password.</li>

                            Simple cryptographic hashes can slow down attackers, but ultimately attackers will be able
                            to overcome them.

                                <li>Although good hash algorithms are supposed to be collision-resistant, collisions are
                                    hard to totally remove. MD5 and SHA-1 have been shown to have known collisions—that
                                    is, they give the same hash value when using different credentials.</li>
                                <li>Rainbow tables are "optimised lookup tables" for reverse-engineering one-way hash
                                    algorithms. A rainbow table is essentially a pre-computed set of plaintext strings
                                    and hashes. Large rainbow tables are publicly available, and attackers can exploit
                                    one of these databases to recover hashed cleartext data.</li>

                            Symmetric Key Cryptography, also known as Symmetric Encryption, is the use of a secret key
                            for both encryption and decryption. This approach is the inverse of Asymmetric Encryption,
                            which uses one key to encrypt and another to decrypt. Data is changed to a format that
                            cannot be read or inspected by anybody who does not know the secret key used to encrypt it
                            throughout this procedure.

                            The strength of the random number generator used to generate the secret key determines the
                            effectiveness of this strategy. Symmetric Key Cryptography is commonly used on the Internet
                            nowadays and comprises mostly of two types of algorithms, Block and Stream.
                            <br><br>
                            The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Data Encryption Standard (DES) are two
                            popular encryption algorithms (DES). This type of encryption is often quicker than
                            Asymmetric encryption, but it needs the secret key to be held by both the sender and the
                            recipient of the material.

                            The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric encryption algorithm, which means it employs both a
                            public and private key (i.e two different, mathematically linked keys). A public key, as the
                            name implies, is shared publicly, but a private key is private and must not be shared with
                            anybody. The RSA algorithm is named after its developers, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and
                            Leonard Adleman, who created it in 1978.
