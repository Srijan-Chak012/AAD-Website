                        <p class="text-lg mb-5">The first documented application of cryptography (in some form) was
                            discovered in an inscription carved circa 1900 BC in the main chamber of the tomb of the
                            Egyptian nobleman Khnumhotep II.
                            In places, the scribe substituted strange hieroglyphic characters with more common ones. The
                            goal was not to conceal the message, but rather to adapt its shape in such a manner that it
                            appeared respectable.
                            Most significant early civilizations have evidence of some usage of cryptography. Kautalya's
                            classic text on statecraft, "Arthshashtra," discusses the Indian spy service and includes
                            assigning spies instructions in "secret writing."
                            <br><br>
                            Julius Caesar was known to utilise encryption to send secret communications to his army
                            generals stationed on the battlefield. This substitution cypher, known as the Caesar cypher,
                            is maybe the most discussed historic encryption in academic literature.
                            To construct the cypher text, each character in the plain text is replaced by another
                            character in a substitution cypher. Caesar's version was a three-cipher shift. Each
                            character was relocated by three positions, thus 'A' was replaced by 'D,' 'B' by 'E,' and so
                            on.
                            <br><br>
                            During the 16th century, Vigenere created a cypher that was allegedly the first to employ an
                            encryption key. In one of his cyphers, the encryption key was repeated numerous times over
                            the whole message,
                            and the cypher text was generated by multiplying the message character by modulo 26.
                            <br><br>
                            Vigenere's cypher, like the Caesar cypher, is readily cracked; nevertheless, Vigenere's
                            cypher introduced the concept of encryption keys into the picture, though it was poorly
                            handled. When compared to Caesar cypher,
                            the message's secret is determined by the secrecy of the encryption key rather than the
                            system's secrecy.

                            When everything went electric at the beginning of the 20th century, Hebern created the
                            Hebern rotor machine, an electro-mechanical device. It makes use of a single rotor, with the
                            secret key placed in a revolving disc. The key encoded a substitution table, and
                            each key press on the keyboard resulted in encrypted text output. This also rotated the disc
                            by one notch, resulting in a new table being utilised for the following plain text
                            character. This was broken one more by employing letter frequencies.

                        <h4 class="mb-4">The Enigma</h4>
                        <p class="text-lg mb-5">
                            The Enigma machine is an encryption device that was invented and used in the early to
                            mid-twentieth century to secure commercial, diplomatic, and military communication. During
                            World War II, Nazi Germany used it extensively in all departments of the German military.
                            The Germans mistakenly felt that using the Enigma system enabled them to communicate
                            securely and so gain a significant edge in World War II. The Enigma machine was thought to
                            be so safe that it was used to encrypt even the most top-secret transmissions.
                            <br><br>
                            Marian Rejewski, a Polish mathematician and cryptanalyst of the Polish Cipher Bureau,
                            exploited the idea of permutations and faults in German military message encipherment
                            methods to crack the message keys of the plugboard Enigma machine around December 1932.
                            Starting in January 1933, the Polish Cipher Bureau devised procedures to bypass the
                            plugboard and locate all components of the daily key, allowing the Cipher Bureau to decode
                            German Enigma transmissions.
                            <br><br>
                            Alan Turing created the British bombe shortly after arriving at Bletchley Park in September
                            1939. The bombe assisted in determining the wheel order, beginning locations of the rotor
                            cores, and the stecker partner of a given letter. This was accomplished by assessing all
                            17,576 potential scrambler positions given a set of wheel commands based on a crib and
                            ciphertext comparison, in order to exclude options that violated the Enigma's known
                            features.
                            <br><br>
                            The detachable drums on the front of the bombe were wired in the same way as the connections
                            formed by Enigma's several rotors. In contrast to them, the input and output connections for
                            the left and right sides were independent, resulting in 104 contacts between each drum and
                            the remainder of the machine. This enables a series of scramblers to be linked using 26-way
                            wires. Metal brushes were used to make electrical connections between the wiring of the
                            revolving drums and the rear plugboard. When the bombe identified a scrambler position with
                            no inconsistencies, it would come to a halt, and the operator would take note of it before
                            resuming it.
